Based on many years of industrial consulting and teaching experience, I can propose personalized training sessions and courses at different levels.

- Introduction to Inverse Problems and Data Assimilation
- Bayesian Methods for Uncertainty Quantification
- Digital Twins: from Model-based to Data-Driven
- Digital Twins for Management and Sovereignty
- Numerical Methods for Digital Twins
- Machine Learning and Surrogate Models for Digital Twins
- Deployment of Digital Twins 

All these courses will include a hands-on part, where the methods learned will be applied to concrete problems. Per-course websites can be set up for reference and for offline learning. Please contact me for further information and details.
