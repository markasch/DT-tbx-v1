This is the companion website for **A Toolbox for Digital Twins: from Model-based to Data-driven. SIAM (2022)**. A  short description of the [book](https://www.siam.org/publications/books/book-series) will go here. All the [codes](/DT-tbx-v1/codes/) from the book examples are available. They can also be obtained directly from my GitHub repository.

A short biography will be placed here. Link to my [homepage](http://masch.perso.math.cnrs.fr). 

Publications related to the subject of Digital Twins can be found on the  [publications page](/DT-tbx-v1/publications/) page. My [previous book](http://bookstore.siam.org/fa11/) is a good source for a detailed presentation of Data Assimilation.

I provide [consulting](/DT-tbx-v1/consulting/)  and [training](/DT-tbx-v1/training/)  for Digital Twins and their implementations. Please see the dedicated pages.

In the [twins](/DT-tbx-v1/twins/) section, a number of models are show-cased and an updated list, with links, is provided.

Links to my social media connections are available in the top- and bottom of page menus.
