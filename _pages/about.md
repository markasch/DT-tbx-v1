This is the companion website for a short description of the [book](https://www.siam.org/publications/books/book-series)...

A short biography here. Link to your favorite [homepage](http://masch.perso.math.cnrs.fr). 

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/DT-tbx-v1/publications/) automatically.
