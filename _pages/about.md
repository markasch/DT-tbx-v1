This is the companion website for... a short description of the [book](https://www.siam.org/publications/books/book-series) will go here.

A short biography will be placed here. Link to my [homepage](http://masch.perso.math.cnrs.fr). 

Publications related to the subject of Digital Twins can be found on the  [publications page](/DT-tbx-v1/publications/) page. My [previous book](http://bookstore.siam.org/fa11/) is a good source for a detailed presentation of Data Assimilation.

Links to my social media connections are available in the top- and bottom page menus.
