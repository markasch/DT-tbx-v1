This is the companion website for **A Toolbox for Digital Twins: from Model-based to Data-driven. SIAM (2022)**. This  [book](https://epubs.siam.org/doi/book/10.1137/1.9781611976977) provides a unique resource for all the modeling and computational tools needed to formulate, test and deploy Digital Twins. All the [codes](/DT-tbx-v1/codes/) from the book examples are available. They can also be obtained directly from my [GitHub repository](https://github.com/markasch/DT-tbx-examples/). Typos and other errors are inevitable, so please help by filling in the [Errata/Feedback](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfV-DzUmItIpC3aV-aMBItX3-TmY3TWVoqh1h3ZtOVTk9EHaA/viewform) form. Your feedback is precious. The current list of errata can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1xkTEB9Z5PYD6KKzJZFU5SxiV9u2NQ6O9vhZXtPd_wSY/edit?usp=sharing).

Here is a preview of the book's [cover](/DT-tbx-v1/assets/pdf/MN06_ASCH_COVER_B_V6.pdf).

My career has covered a lot of ground: from academia to industry, passing through governmental, European and international institutions. Learning from all of these, has provided a broad persepctive of how and what mathematics can propose to society.
For more details, please consult my [homepage](http://masch.perso.math.cnrs.fr) and recent [CV](/DT-tbx-v1/assets/pdf/Asch_CV_2021.pdf). 

Publications related to the subject of Digital Twins can be found on the  [publications page](/DT-tbx-v1/publications/) page. My [previous book](http://bookstore.siam.org/fa11/) remains a good source for a detailed presentation of Data Assimilation.

I provide [consulting](/DT-tbx-v1/consulting/)  and [training](/DT-tbx-v1/training/)  for Digital Twins and their implementations. Please see the dedicated pages.

In the [twins](/DT-tbx-v1/twins/) section, a number of models are show-cased and an updated list, with links, is provided.

Please consult regularly the [blog](/DT-tbx-v1/blog/) section, where you will find updates, timely and additional material, as well as invited posts written by eminent colleagues.

Links to my social media connections are available in the top- and bottom of page menus.
