Knowledge o underwater sediment properties is important in different environmental contexts. It is needed for: 

- sonar communications,
- biodiversity monitoring (see this [twin](/DT-tbx-v1/projects/whales/)),
- detection of buried objects (see this [twin]/DT-tbx-v1/projects/flints/).

Over the ten-year period 2001-2011, my group was involved in numerous projects, leading up to a three-week mission at sea, where  real-time inversion was performed using sockets, as described in this [post](/DT-tbx-v1/blog/2021/DT-stereo/).

Mathematically, we have a classical imaging inverse problem to solve:

    </div>
</div>
<div class="caption">
    The imaging problem: given a source and an array where measurements are obtained, find the properties of the unknown medium.
</div>

This model is readily adapted to a realistic context of underwater sedimentology characterization, as shown below.

We have successfully performed inversion of the sediment properties and the sound-speed profile in the water layer, using an adjoint approach {% cite Hermand2006a  %}.
