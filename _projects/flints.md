Due to the rise in sea-level over the past 20 000 years, numerous archeological sites close to existing coastlines, are now submerged. Detecting these sites, by non-invasive means, is important for world cultural heritage. Just as we did for biodiversity monitoring of [whales](/DT-tbx-v1/projects/whales/), acoustic exploration is indicated here. In particular, since flint relics often characterize the presence of pre-historic sites in particular, we can exploit the fact that they have very pronounced acoustic resonance signatures to probe coastal waters. This is very close to what we did in the [sediment mapping](/DT-tbx-v1/projects/OAT/) twin, and the principles and methods used for the modeling are similar.

Actual flints were digitized and their geometry transferred by CAD software to a mesher, and then collections of flints were embedded in a faithful representation of the coastal underwater sediments.

Time-domain simulations of the acouric-elastic wave equation were performed with the [SPECFEM](https://geodynamics.org/cig/software/specfem2d/) code an then frequency spectra were computed. By taking the difference between simulations with and without flints, we easily detect their presence as well as their resonances. This is illlustrated in the figures below.
