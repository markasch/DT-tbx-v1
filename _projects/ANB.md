The following images show the passage from mathematical model, to simulations, to reality. In between, experimental verification of the localization was performed in the lab, and real acoustic tests of the pre-final product were perfomed in an anechoic chamber as well as in an exterior setting.

A commercial product patented under the name Fractal WallÂ®, based on this twin, absorbs on average 98% of the incident acoustic energy in the audio spectrum, for normalized traffic noise.
