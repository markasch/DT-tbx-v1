I implemented a real-time digital twin, sometime ago, to perform underwater sediment mapping - please see the description in the [twins](/DT-tbx-v1/twins/) tab.

In this post I will explain the technique used for communicating, in real-time, with the measurement instruments---in this case, a sonar array made up of a towed sound-source and stationary hydrophones forming a vertical antenna under the water surface. The geo-referenced pings were received from the antenna, at regular intervals, and transmitted to the workstation over a local network. The actual determination of the sediment properties, essentially the sediment density, was perfomed by solving a parameter estimation inverse problem for the acoustic wave equation, based on these measurements.</p>

Since the inversion code was written in Matlab, we used the `pnet`  function from the [TCP/UDP/IP Toolbox.](https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/345-tcp-udp-ip-toolbox-2-0-6) This toolbox  can  set up TCP/IP connections or
send/receive UDP/IP packets in MATLAB. It can transmit data over an Intranet, either between MATLAB processes or other applications. It can act as server and/or client and can transmit textstrings, arrays of any datatype, files or MATLAB variables. In our case, we used it to transmit both data (in the form of `.xml` files) and commands for synchronizing the different actions and stages of the acquisition-inversion-ouput cycle.

Here is a code extract that shows how we coded the (infinite) listening loop, the data transmission and the actual call of the inversion routine, `run_calcul`.

{% highlight matlab linenos %}

function [outputs] = run_inv(handles,hObject,port_inv)
% Initialize port, socket
port_inv = 6666;
sock=pnet('tcpsocket',port_inv);
if(sock==-1); error('The TCP port %d is not available',port_inv); end
net(sock,'setreadtimeout',1);
disp(sprintf('\nInversion launched on port %d (waiting for START...)',port_inv));
disp('... to stop: ctrl-C then pnet(''closeall'') ...'); disp(' ');
while (1) %infinite loop of HTTP server    
    % Initialize the connection
    con=pnet(sock,'tcplisten');
    while (con==-1), % no connection
        con=pnet(sock,'tcplisten');
    end
    [ip,port]=pnet(con,'gethost');
    disp(sprintf('Connection from host:%d.%d.%d.%d port:%d\n',ip,port));
    pnet(con,'setreadtimeout', 4);  % do not block server if no request
    pnet(con,'setwritetimeout',1);
    disp('Waiting for request');
    attente = 0;
    while (pnet(con,'status')>0)            % Loop to read requests
        data=pnet(con,'readline',4000000);  % Read the socket
        .
        .
        %-----------------------------------------------------%
        % here we start the treatment of the inversion request
        %-----------------------------------------------------%
        run_calcul(con,obj,test_4S,handles,hObject);                                
        disp(sprintf('*** Exit from inversion\n'));
    end
 end %End of HTTP server loop 
 pnet(sock,'close');

For the actual deployment of the DT, the complete process was piloted by a GUI that controlled all the stages and displayed all the results.
