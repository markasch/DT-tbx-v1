description: on the good usage of performance metrics
---

As mentioned in the [post](/DT-tbx-v1/blog/2022/SUMO/) on practical surrogate modeling, special care should be taken when using and reporting performance metrics. We will discuss three major points here:

1. Use of $$p$$-values for regression coefficients.
2. Use of $$R^2$$ for regression analysis.
3. Use of accuracy for classification results.

These have already been discussed over the web, and point 1 has received particular attention, even being the subject of a major [declaration](https://amstat.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00031305.2016.1154108#.Vt2XIOaE2MN) of the American Statistical Society. Their advice (in a nutshell): do **NOT** use $$p$$-values at all. Their (poliically-correct) conclusion is:

Good statistical practice, as an essential component of good scientific practice, emphasizes principles of good study design and conduct, a variety of numerical and graphical summaries of data, understanding of the phenomenon under study, interpretation of results in context, complete reporting and proper logical and quantitative understanding of what data summaries mean. No single index should substitute for scientific reasoning.
